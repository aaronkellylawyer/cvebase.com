## About this repository
This repository contains the Markdown files for the two main components of cvebase.com:
* `cve`: CVE files are located in the `/cve/` directory, organized by year and sequence identifier following the naming scheme set by [`CVEProject/cvelist`](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist).
* `researcher`: Researcher profiles are in the `/researcher/` directory, named by researcher slug.

Inspired by static site generator [`gohugoio/hugo`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), the Markdown files have YAML "front matter" to define metadata for both CVEs and Researchers.

See example files here:
* [/cve/2020/15xxx/CVE-2020-15505.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvebase/cvebase.com/main/cve/2020/15xxx/CVE-2020-15505.md)
* [/researcher/orange.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvebase/cvebase.com/main/researcher/orange.md)
